# C4.5_beer_classification

A general implementation of Ross Quinlan's `C4.5 Algorithm`, built from scratch with python 3.8, with the goal of classifying a particular dataset.

A `one-to-one` multiclass classification approach was taken for the example dataset provided.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone this repository.

For the main algorithm you will need the following python packages:
`pandas`
`numpy`
`random`
`os`

The main code is contained in the `main.py` file, if you wish to classify the provided dataset you will need to input its filename and path into the console following the prompts.

This can also be used to classify other datasets, specify the filename and path and follow the other instructions.

Output can be seen in the `output.csv` file, or another filename if specified.

## Reflection

This was a required project for my studies, and I am satisfied with the results obtained.

There is certainly room for improvement with this program, in particular with efficiency and a potential reduction in code verbosity.
